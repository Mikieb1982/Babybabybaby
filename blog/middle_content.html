    Choosing the Perfect Middle Name
</h1>

<p>So, you've picked out a fantastic first name for your little one â€“ congratulations! But now comes the next step: the middle name...</p>

<h2>Finding the Flow: Rhythm, Sound, and Feel</h2>
<p>How the names sound together is key...</p>

<h2>Trust Your Choice</h2>
<p>Ultimately, the best middle name is the one that resonates with you...</p>


Action Needed:
 * Create the 5 _content.html files listed above inside your blog/ folder.
 * Copy the main article content (headings, paragraphs, images, lists, tables) from your original blog post files into the corresponding _content.html file.
 * Crucially, check image paths (src) within these snippets. Since these snippets will be loaded into blog.html (which is one level up from the blog/ folder), image paths should likely start with ../assets/ (e.g., ../assets/middletile.png).
 * Once you have created these 5 content files, let me know, and we can test if the swipe navigation works correctly.
