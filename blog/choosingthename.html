          <p>Choosing a name for your child is one of the most significant decisions you'll make as a parent. A
            name is more than just a label; it's a gift that accompanies your child throughout their entire life,
            shaping their identity and how they are perceived by the world. The process of naming can be both
            exciting and overwhelming. This guide offers some valuable tips to help you find the perfect name for
            your little one.</p>

        <!-- --- Section: Consider the Meaning --- -->
        <section>
          <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl text-dark-text pt-6 mb-4">Consider the Meaning</h2>
          <p>The meaning behind a name can add a beautiful layer of depth and significance. Many parents are drawn
            to names with meanings that resonate with their hopes and dreams for their child. Whether you're looking
            for a name that means "strong," "wise," or "beloved," exploring the meanings behind names can be a
            rewarding part of the naming journey. Take some time to research different origins and the meanings
            associated with names that catch your eye.</p>

          <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl text-dark-text pt-6 mb-4">Say It Out Loud</h2>
          <p>It's one thing to like how a name looks on paper, and another to hear it spoken. Saying the name out
            loud allows you to evaluate its flow and sound. Consider how the first, middle, and last names sound
            together. Is it easy to say? Does it roll off the tongue smoothly? Also, think about nicknames that
            might naturally arise from the name. Are you comfortable with these potential nicknames?</p>

          <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl text-dark-text pt-6 mb-4">Think Long Term</h2>
          <p>While it's fun to consider cute baby names, it's equally important to think about how the name will
            age. A name that's adorable on a toddler should also suit a teenager, an adult, and a senior citizen.
            Will the name be suitable for professional settings? Will it be a name that your child can confidently
            carry throughout their life? These are important considerations to keep in mind.</p>
